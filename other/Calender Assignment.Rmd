```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ical)

path <- "/Users/laurenpelosi/Desktop/git/Personal-Repository/other"
filename <- "calender.ics"
```


```{r cars}
calendar <- ical_parse_df(file = paste0(path,"/",filename)) %>%
  mutate(start_datetime = with_tz(start, tzone = "America/New_York")
    , end_datetime = with_tz(end, tzone = "America/New_York")
    , length_hour = end_datetime - start_datetime
    , date = floor_date(start_datetime, unit = "day")) 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example: 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
